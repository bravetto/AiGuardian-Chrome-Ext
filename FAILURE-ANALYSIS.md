# Guard Services Failure Analysis

## 🔍 Executive Summary

**Status:** End-to-end flow ✅ WORKS | Guard processing ❌ BLOCKED

The extension → backend → guard services flow is **functioning correctly**, but **all guard services are returning 403 Forbidden** errors, indicating they require authentication or are not publicly accessible.

---

## 📊 Detailed Failure Breakdown

### 1. **BiasGuard** ❌ FAILING

**Error:** `Service returned status 403: HTTP 403`

**What's Happening:**
- ✅ Request reaches backend gateway
- ✅ Backend routes to BiasGuard service
- ✅ BiasGuard service receives request
- ❌ BiasGuard returns HTTP 403 Forbidden
- ✅ Error propagates back to extension

**Root Cause:**
- BiasGuard service requires authentication
- Service is likely behind Tailscale VPN (internal network)
- Service may require API keys or authentication tokens

**Impact:**
- Cannot analyze text for bias detection
- Extension receives error response
- User sees failure message

**Solution:**
- Add authentication headers to requests
- Configure service to accept requests from gateway
- Or make service publicly accessible (if appropriate)

---

### 2. **TrustGuard** ❌ FAILING (Two Issues)

#### Issue A: Missing Required Field
**Error:** `Internal error: output_text is required for TrustGuard validation`

**What's Happening:**
- ✅ Request reaches backend gateway
- ✅ Backend routes to TrustGuard service
- ❌ TrustGuard validates payload and rejects it
- Error: Missing `output_text` field

**Root Cause:**
- TrustGuard expects both `text` (input) and `output_text` (AI-generated output)
- Extension only sends `text` field
- TrustGuard is designed to validate AI output against input

**Impact:**
- Cannot validate AI-generated content
- Extension needs to provide both input and output

**Solution:**
- Update extension to include `output_text` in payload
- Or use TrustGuard only when validating AI outputs

#### Issue B: Authentication Required
**Error:** `Service returned status 403: HTTP 403` (even with `output_text`)

**What's Happening:**
- ✅ Request includes `output_text` field
- ✅ Backend routes to TrustGuard service
- ❌ TrustGuard returns HTTP 403 Forbidden

**Root Cause:**
- Even with correct payload, service requires authentication
- Service is likely behind Tailscale VPN

**Impact:**
- Cannot validate AI outputs even with correct payload

**Solution:**
- Add authentication headers
- Configure service access

---

### 3. **ContextGuard** ❌ FAILING

**Error:** `Service returned status 403: HTTP 403`

**What's Happening:**
- ✅ Request reaches backend gateway
- ✅ Backend routes to ContextGuard service
- ✅ ContextGuard service receives request
- ❌ ContextGuard returns HTTP 403 Forbidden

**Root Cause:**
- ContextGuard requires authentication
- Service is likely behind Tailscale VPN (internal network)
- Service may require API keys or authentication tokens

**Impact:**
- Cannot detect context drift
- Cannot manage context/memory

**Solution:**
- Add authentication headers to requests
- Configure service to accept requests from gateway
- Or make service publicly accessible (if appropriate)

---

### 4. **TokenGuard** ❌ FAILING

**Error:** `Service returned status 403: HTTP 403`

**What's Happening:**
- ✅ Request reaches backend gateway
- ✅ Backend routes to TokenGuard service
- ✅ TokenGuard service receives request
- ❌ TokenGuard returns HTTP 403 Forbidden

**Root Cause:**
- TokenGuard requires authentication
- Service is likely behind Tailscale VPN (internal network)
- Service may require API keys or authentication tokens

**Impact:**
- Cannot optimize/compress text
- Cannot reduce token usage

**Solution:**
- Add authentication headers to requests
- Configure service to accept requests from gateway
- Or make service publicly accessible (if appropriate)

---

## 🎯 Root Cause Summary

### Primary Issue: **Authentication Required**

**All guard services are returning 403 Forbidden**, which means:

1. **Services are Protected**
   - Services require authentication (API keys, tokens, or internal network access)
   - Services are likely behind Tailscale VPN
   - Services are not publicly accessible

2. **Gateway Cannot Authenticate**
   - Gateway is not sending authentication headers
   - Gateway may not have credentials configured
   - Gateway may not be on the same network (Tailscale)

3. **Network Access**
   - Services may only accept requests from specific IPs/networks
   - Tailscale connection may not be configured for gateway
   - Services may require VPN connection

---

## ✅ What IS Working

1. **Extension → Backend Gateway**
   - ✅ Extension successfully sends requests
   - ✅ Backend receives requests correctly
   - ✅ Backend validates payload format
   - ✅ Backend generates request IDs

2. **Backend → Guard Services**
   - ✅ Backend routes requests to correct services
   - ✅ Services receive requests
   - ✅ Services process requests (validate payloads)
   - ✅ Services return structured responses

3. **Response Flow**
   - ✅ Services return error responses
   - ✅ Backend propagates errors correctly
   - ✅ Extension receives structured error responses
   - ✅ Error messages are clear and informative

4. **Performance**
   - ✅ All requests complete in < 100ms
   - ✅ Processing times are tracked
   - ✅ Request IDs are generated

## 🔧 Solutions & Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Check Tailscale Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Verify Tailscale is connected
   tailscale status
   
   # Check if gateway can reach guard services
   curl http://biasguard:8004/health
   curl http://trustguard:8002/health
   curl http://contextguard:8003/health
   curl http://tokenguard:8001/health
   ```

2. **Verify Service Authentication**
   - Check if services require API keys
   - Check if services require authentication tokens
   - Check service configuration files

3. **Configure Gateway Authentication**
   - Add API keys to gateway configuration
   - Add authentication headers to requests
   - Configure service access permissions

### Long-term Solutions

1. **Service Access Configuration**
   - Configure services to accept requests from gateway
   - Add gateway IP/network to allowlist
   - Configure Tailscale ACLs if needed

2. **Authentication Implementation**
   - Add authentication middleware to gateway
   - Store service credentials securely
   - Implement token refresh if needed

3. **Payload Format Updates**
   - Update TrustGuard payload to include `output_text`
   - Document required fields for each service
   - Update extension to send correct payloads
